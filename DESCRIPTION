Description: An implementation of non-linear mixed models
    for the alignment of data. It primarily deals with time-course
    data of different targets which have been measured under different
    experimental conditions and whose measured values might be on a
    different scale, e.g. because of different amplification.
    The algorithm determines the different scaling and estimates the
    time-course on a common scale.
