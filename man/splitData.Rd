\usage{
splitData(data, fixed, latent, normalize_input, log)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame with columns "name", "time", "value" and others}

\item{fixed}{two-sided formula, see \link{alignME}}

\item{latent}{two-sided formula, see \link{alignME}}

\item{normalize_input}{logical, if set to TRUE, the input data will be
normalized by dividing all entries belonging to one scaling factor by their
 respective mean. This prevents convergence failure on some hardware when the
 data for different latent effects differ by to many orders of magnitude.}
}
\value{
list of data frames
}
\description{
Split data in independent blocks according to fixed and latent
variables as being defined for \link{alignME}.
