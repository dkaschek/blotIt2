# BlotIt2 - Optimal alignment of biological replicate data

The BlotIt2 package is a toolbox that provides functions to align data whose measured values might be on different scales, e.g. because of different amplification 
as it is the case with Western Blots or Reverse Phase Protein Arrays.
It is primarily designed for time-course data of different targets which have been measured under different experimental conditions. 
The algorithm determines the different scaling and estimates the time-course on a common scale.
